  description: |-
    Improves the performance of the "golint" check by several orders of magnitude by downgrading the "golang.org/x/tools" module dependency from v0.26.0 -> v0.1.10.

    This fixes the major performance regression introduced in version v1.37.0 of this check.

    Because "golint" itself is deprecated/frozen, using not keeping this dependency up-to-date should not be an issue.

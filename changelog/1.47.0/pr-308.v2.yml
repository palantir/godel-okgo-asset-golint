  description: |-
    Updates `golint` check to set the GOROOT environment variable to the output of `go env GOROOT` if it is not set. This fixes an issue where, otherwise, GOROOT would fall back to the value set by the `go` executable when the check was built, which is not helpful.

    Also removes the flag to profile the check.
